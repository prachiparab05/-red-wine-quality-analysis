# 📊 Red Wine Quality Analysis – Tableau Project

## 📝 Overview
This Tableau project explores the quality of red wine by analyzing various physicochemical properties. Using interactive visualizations, the project aims to identify patterns and factors that contribute to wine quality.

## 📌 Key Questions Answered

1. **What is the distribution of wine quality?**  
   A histogram shows that most red wines are rated between 5 and 7, indicating an average quality distribution.

2. **What are the differences in acidity levels between low- and high-quality wines?**  
   A box plot comparing volatile acidity across different quality levels reveals that higher quality wines tend to have **lower variation** in acidity, suggesting consistency.

3. **What is the best combination of factors for producing high-quality wine?**  
   A scatter plot with color-coding shows:
   - High-quality wines generally have **higher alcohol content**
   - **Lower volatile acidity**  
   These characteristics indicate that fruity aroma (from low acidity) and strong alcohol content are preferred.
